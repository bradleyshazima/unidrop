## üì¶ Libraries & APIs Used

* **`express`**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **`cors`**: Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.
* **`child_process`**: Node.js module for spawning child processes, crucial for running `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`.
* **`fs`**: Node.js file system module, used for file operations and stream handling.
* **`path`**: Node.js module for working with file and directory paths.
* **`tmp`**: A robust and intuitive temporary file and directory creator for Node.js.
* **`yt-dlp`**: A command-line program to download videos from YouTube and other video sites (a fork of `youtube-dl`).
* **`FFmpeg`**: A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. (Used in earlier iterations for merging, though current version focuses on direct streaming).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

During the development of Unidrop, a significant challenge arose with direct video streaming from the backend to the client. Specifically, for certain platforms like TikTok and Pinterest, attempting to pipe `yt-dlp`'s output directly to the browser's response stream often resulted in a `ERR_INVALID_RESPONSE` or `Client disconnected` error on the client side.

Even though `yt-dlp` was successfully extracting the video, the immediate byte stream was not always in a format or delivered at a speed that browsers expected for live playback/download. This led to the client prematurely closing the connection.

To address this, the current implementation (as of this commit) re-introduces a robust buffering mechanism:
1.  The selected video format is **first downloaded completely to a temporary file** on the server.
2.  Once the temporary file is fully downloaded and validated, a **read stream is created from this local file and then piped to the client**.

This approach ensures that the client receives a complete and well-formed video stream from the very beginning, significantly improving download reliability across diverse video sources.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run Unidrop locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* `yt-dlp`: [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and ensure its path is correctly configured in `index.js`.
* `ffmpeg` (optional, if you re-introduce merging logic): [Download from ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and ensure it's in your system's PATH or its path is configured in `index.js`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bradleyshazima/unidrop.git](https://github.com/bradleyshazima/unidrop.git)
    cd unidrop
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (`server` directory):**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    * **Configure `YT_DLP_PATH`**: Open `index.js` and set the `YT_DLP_PATH` variable to the full path of your `yt-dlp.exe` (or `yt-dlp` if on Linux/macOS).
        ```javascript
        const YT_DLP_PATH = "C:/Users/brady/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/Scripts/yt-dlp.exe"; 
        ```
    * Start the backend server:
        ```bash
        node index.js
        ```
        The server should start on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Frontend Setup (if separate `client` directory, adjust path if not):**
    ```bash
    cd ../client # Adjust if your frontend is in a different directory
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the React development server, usually on `http://localhost:3000`.

Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
